                <p id="slisk">
                    We are Europe’s only ultra low cost carrier, and that means we bring you the lowest fares on flights to all of our destinations – and that’s guaranteed.<br/><br/>
                    From the moment Dzenky Air embraced a no-frills, low-cost, get-you-from-A-to-B model, we’ve pretty much revolutionised the air travel industry. We get you from A to B, and we get you there cheaper, and more reliably, than any other airline.<br/><br/>
                    Dzenky Air made air travel accessible to the masses, and we opened Europe up for tourism in a way it had never been opened before. Even when our competitors saw what we were doing and arrived on the scene to get a little piece of the action – well, we upped our game and lowered our fares. We want to bring you not just cheap flights, but the cheapest flights available to all of our destinations, and we are prepared to do whatever we have to do to keep our costs down so that we can keep your costs down.<br/><br/>
                    We are focussed on, and committed to, bringing you the lowest fares and most on-time flights out of all our competitors, so that they’re not really competitors at all. Of course there are some things we never compromise on - most importantly your safety, but also our top drawer punctuality, our near-perfect baggage handling, and our efficient ‘green’ policy.<br/><br/>
                    Dzenky Air has grown from a single-aircraft family operation into an international airlines, and we’re proud of that. We own Europe’s most modern fleet of Boeing 737-800 Aircraft – currently 2, with 2 more on order – which operate over appr. 2 flights every day, across 16 routes, connecting 4 destinations in 4 different countries where our team of over 80 skilled professionals help get our 110 000 passengers where they need to go – and safely, with our exemplary 1 year safety record.<br/><br/>
                    But the only numbers you really need to know about are the fares – and we guarantee that those numbers will always be smaller than everyone else’s.<br/><br/>
