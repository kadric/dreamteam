                            Book flights to Frankfurt and discover more than just a business hub – yes, Frankfurt is the financial heart of Germany, but you’d be doing it a disservice to dismiss it as just skyscrapers and suits. If Frankfurt likes to work hard, it knows how to play hard too, so you won’t find yourself short of a good time! Sachsenhousen is where the fun really kicks off – go to a traditional tavern and try the city’s famous Apfelwein – and if you fancy a bite, you must visit Fressgasse (its literal translation is ‘Munch Alley’). If you fancy a trip outside the city, you’re never too far away from some superb vineyards and relaxing spa towns!

                            Sachsenhausen is a charming area with cobbled streets and many museums by Schaumainkai. In the north of central Frankfurt lies Bornheim, nicknamed das Lustige Dorf – the funny village. It is the city’s most densely populated area and has recently seen an influx in bohemian-chic. Westend is comparable to London’s fashionable West End.
                            <br/><br/>
                            A wide variety of restaurants and upscale eateries can be found all over Frankfurt. The most exciting ones are located in bohemian Sachsenhausen and fashionable Westend. Most tourists walk down Fressgass, the city’s culinary main street. Though cafés, restaurants, bistros and delis line both sides of the street, only a few offer something special.

                            Frankfurt is well-known for its apple cider, "Äppelwoi," so do not miss the city’s famous cider pubs! You can easily find a place to try the famous drink or maybe just an ordinary, nice cup of coffee.

                            Frankfurt has a very diverse and surprisingly un-German mix of bars. The reason for this is the large student population, the expats, businessmen, the city’s young banking elite and its very wealthy inhabitants. The truly unique places to go are the cider pubs in the Sachsenhausen district.   When it comes to trendy nightclubs and discos, the best advice is to ask around for the latest and greatest places.

                            There are fun shops in most areas of Frankfurt, but the most popular shopping area is in the centre of the city. The main pedestrian street Zeil offers two classic department stores, Kaufhof and Karstadt. This is also where you will find the Zeilgalerie mall with its seven floors and a roof terrace with great views of the city.   The westernmost part of Zeil eventually changes its name to Fressgass. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            If you are looking for Gucci, Escada and Versace your best bet is to head for Goethestrasse, a more exclusive version of Zeil. Nearby, Schillerstrasse has a nice market every Friday morning.   In the Sachsenhausen area, south of the Maine River, is a more charming shopping area that caters to younger people. The main street, Schweizerstrasse, is full of delis, bookshops, trendy cafes and shops like Hype and Bailly Diehl.

                            The general pace of things is also slower here than over on Zeil. On Saturdays from 8 am-2 pm a large flea market takes over the area around the Museumsufer Embankment.   Those who are looking for funkier shopping should go to the Bornheim area. Bergerstrasse has exciting design, fashion and vintage shops. Go there on a Saturday morning and experience the farmers market by the Uhrtürmchen clock tower. Kontrast, on Hanauer Landstrasse 297, in the Ostend area, has six floors of modern furniture design in a distinctively East Berlin style building.
