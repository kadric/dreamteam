                            For over four hundred years, mosques, synagogues, Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches have been built and have stood side by side here. 

                            Citizens of different nationalities and religious backgrounds have lived and worked together to forge a multicultural city which absorbs different heritage of the East and the West. That is why the city today is often referred to as the European Jerusalem.

                            Ilidza is located 12 km from the centre of the city at the foot of the Mt. Igman. Ilidza was the first settlement in Sarajevo back in the Neolithic period. The name was derived from the term iladz – the one who heals, as Ilidza was known to Romans and their ancestors as the thermal, spa and healing centre of Sarajevo. Ottomans recognized the same values and continued to inhabit Ilidza and built numerous spas. During the Austro-Hungarian period, Ilidza was a trendy place as well.
                            Some of the most valuable remains of other civilizations who lived here in the past are the Roman settlement Aquae S… (present day the Archaeological Park), the Roman Bridge (Bridge at Plandiste dating back to the 16th century) and a hotel complex with additional facilities and amenities built during the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Today, modern spa hotel facilities use these springs and natural thermal spa water in some of their rehabilitation treatments.

                            The three-kilometre long avenue of plane trees and horse chestnuts runs from Ilidza to Vrelo Bosne. The alley has over 700 trees dating back to 1880’s. The spring (Vrelo Bosne) rises at the foot of Mt. Igman and has over 60 karst springs. It has recently been proclaimed a natural monument due to its morphological, hydrological, botanical and horticultural features.
                            <br/><br/>
                            This is one of the locals’ favourite outdoor spots. Many visitors take a coach - ride along the tree avenue dating back to the Austro-Hungarian period (the first coach ride was established in 1895). The coach-ride fare is 10 euros (approximately 20 KM). Along the coach-riding alley, there are two narrow walking paths on each side.

                            Sports and recreational outdoor venue, Stojcevac, is also very close to Vrelo Bosne. It is very popular for bicycle riding, jogging, skating, etc…
